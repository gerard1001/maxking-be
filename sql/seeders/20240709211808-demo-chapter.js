            '<h2>Blood Flow</h2><p>Blood flow refers to the movement of blood through the vessels from arteries to the capillaries and then into the veins. Pressure is a measure of the force that the blood exerts against the vessel walls as it moves the blood through the vessels.

Blood flows in the same direction as the decreasing pressure gradient: arteries to capillaries to veins.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://api.seer.cancer.gov/rest/glossary/latest/id/554401b5e4b0426fced3e45a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 101, 168);">rate</a>, or velocity, of blood flow varies inversely with the total cross-sectional area of the blood vessels.

When there is a total laryngectomy the person has a permanent stoma, there is no longer communication to the upper airway, and the patient is no longer able to speak normally and uses some artificial means of speech. Similarly, parathyroidectomy refers to a surgery to remove parathyroid glands or tumors.</p><h2>En Bloc Resection</h2><p>An en bloc resection is a surgical procedure in which a lesion and surrounding tissues are removed as a whole. "En bloc" or "in continuity with" means that all of the tissues were removed during the same procedure in one section.</p>',

          description:
            'Chemotherapy is a distinctively different approach than surgery and radiation therapy to treat cancer. Chemotherapy is used as primary treatment, neoadjuvant, adjuvant treatment, and as palliative. Rather than physically removing a tumor or a part of it, chemotherapy uses chemical agents (anti-cancer or cytotoxic drugs) to interact with cancer cells to eradicate or control the growth of cancer. Chemotherapy is used after surgery as adjuvant treatment to eradicate any microscopic cancer cells, and/or to decrease the likelihood of cancer recurrence.',

            '<p>Chemotherapy is often used as a neoadjuvant treatment. When chemotherapy is used as neoadjuvant treatment, it is designed to reduce the size and or bulk of the tumor so surgical resection can more easily be performed.</p><p>Essentially chemotherapy is used in several ways:</p><ul><li>Primary treatment for the cancer – systemic therapy only</li><li>As neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery</li><li>As adjuvant or added treatment for potential microscopic disease and/or to reduce cancer recurrence</li><li>As a palliative treatment when the cancer cannot be eradicated to control pain by reducing size of the cancer and controlling other symptoms</li><li>Chemotherapy may also be used in combination with radiation therapy and during surgery</li></ul><p>Chemotherapy drugs works by</p><ul><li>interfering with DNA synthesis</li><li>damaging a cell\'s genetic material (DNA)</li><li>preventing the cell from dividing</li></ul><p>Since chemotherapeutic drugs cannot distinguish between normal cells and cancer cells, both types of cells are affected by chemotherapy. Toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents to normal cells is the cause of unpleasant side effects. However, the value of chemotherapy lies in the fact that the killing effect of chemotherapeutic agents has a definite selectivity for cancer cells over normal host cells. Normal tissues are able to repair themselves and continue to grow, so the injury caused by chemotherapy is rarely permanent.</p><p>Chemotherapy is a systemic method of cancer treatment. The drugs used in chemotherapy are able to reach most parts of the body. Therefore, chemotherapy is likely to be recommended for</p><ul><li>cancer that has already spread to other areas of the body</li><li>tumors that occur at more than one site</li><li>tumors that cannot be removed surgically</li><li>treat recurrent disease</li></ul><h2>Advantages of Chemotherapy</h2><ul><li>less mutilating than surgery</li><li>helps conserve organ or limb function</li><li>for some cancers, chemotherapy alone can destroy all the cancer cells</li><li>as an adjuvant treatment increases the effectiveness of cancer treatment</li><li>can minimize the discomfort caused by cancer</li><li>can reduce the risk of recurrence</li><li>can slow the progression of the disease</li><li>can prolong survival</li></ul><p>Chemotherapy is given via many routes including but not limited to intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular and oral.

This type of chemotherapy is called adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>As a palliative therapy, chemotherapy can be used to help make the cancer patient\'s life as comfortable as possible. In the case of inoperative cancers, chemotherapy is administered to relieve symptoms and serious complications. As a palliative therapy, chemotherapy, when given in non-therapeutic doses, can help make the cancer patient’s life as comfortable as possible.</p><p>Every cancer is unique, as is every cancer patient; therefore, the oncologist takes great care to tailor the chemotherapy plan to the particular case.
